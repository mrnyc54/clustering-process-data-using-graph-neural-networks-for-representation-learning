This is the Code repository accompanying my master thesis "Clustering Process Data using Graph Neural Networks for Representation Learning".
The Code in this foilder implements ProcessGraph2vec runs it on datasets BPIC2015 and BPIC2019 and clusters the results.

Prerequisites:
1. Install anaconda

To run Code:
1. Create conda environment form environment.yml:
conda env create --name $yourname --file=./environment.yml

2. Activate conda env
conda activate $yourname

With this environment you can run either subproject. Each has its own readme, what steps you need to do next.
